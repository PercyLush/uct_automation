  "Description": "Tourism has become a fiercely competitive business. As such, it is not simply the stock of natural resources of South Africa that will determine her competitiveness in tourism, but rather, how these resources are managed; hence the need for trained personnel. South Africa has opened the country’s tourism potential to the rest of the world and indeed to the previously neglected groups in society. At tertiary level, training in tourism and hospitality services is offered at limited number of public and private institutions. With a total training capacity of some 10 000 and industry expected to require 100 000 people per year (tourism white paper), training capacity falls short of the needs. There is an urgent need for a wide range of basic skills among persons who are the first line of contact with the customer.",

  "Description": "Administration, also referred to as business administration, is the management of an office, business, or organisation. It involves the efficient organisation of people, information, and other resources to achieve organisational objectives.\n\nInformation is key to business operations, and people are the resources who make use of information to add value to an organisation. This means that companies will struggle without some type of administration management.",

Many of these industries have pledged support to the programmes.  Although the department has plans to introduce many qualifications, it offers two qualifications currently: Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering and Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical Engineering. These qualifications fit in well with the activities of the surrounding industries and gives the university an opportunity of easy experiential learning placement for some of the students. Engineering is one of the scarce skills in South Africa and there are many career opportunities both in industry and parastatal bodies.",
