On the main campus, paved walkways wind between campus buildings – some dating from previous centuries; others just a few years old. Architecture from various eras attests to the sound academic foundation and establishment of an institution of excellence. This, together with the scenic beauty of the area; state-of-the-art, environmentally friendly facilities and technology, as well as visionary thinking about the creation of a sustainable 21st-century institution, makes for the unique character of Stellenbosch University.",
  "FunFact": "The history of Stellenbosch University (SU) dates as far back as the 17th century, when regular school education was initiated in the town of Stellenbosch in 1685. With the start of the Theological Seminary of the Dutch Reformed Church in 1859, higher education became established in the town. In December 1863, the foundation was laid for the establishment of the Stellenbosch Gymnasium, which became a reality in 1866. \r\nLess than a decade after the establishment of the Gymnasium, in 1874, the so-called Arts Department was founded. The Department started out with 120 scholars and two professors of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, and Classical and English Literature respectively. In 1879, the decision was made to build a proper college building to create more teaching space. The new building was inaugurated on 6 November 1886 and renamed Victoria College in 1887 in honour of Queen Victoria's golden jubilee, the 50-year celebration of her ascent to the British throne. ",

Limitations in staff, laboratory equipment and libraries made tuition inadequate. It was obvious that only a central university college could provide a satisfactory standard of university education.",

In 1988 the university purchased the former premises of the Eunice Primary School campus of the Bloemfontein College of Education. Before long these were followed by the Main Building (today known as ZR Mahabane Building); the bhpBilliton Building, which houses a large portion of the Faculty of Engineering and Information Technology; Dirk Coetzee Building, which houses the Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Prosperitas Auditorium, as well as Boet Troskie Hall; and a modern Library and Information Service.

Presently all our Pasquale Stylists, other than the owners, have come through the Pasquale ranks and have been trained by Pasquale.\n\nWe have a 450 square meter salon which works hand in hand with our academy which is only 1km away from the salon, to create successful hairstylists. Our salon is large enough to employ all our students and this enables the student to do both the academy hours and salon hours under the Pasquale umbrella which gives us complete control over the student reaching his/her full potential and becoming the best hairstylist possible. There is a Mentoring System in place in the salon with each qualified hairstylist committed to training their students.",

He identified the root cause of the problem, namely ‘management incompetence’ at both first-line and middle management levels which was endemic throughout all three companies.\n\nUnable to identify any suitable local management training courses aimed at ‘practicing’ managers, he decided to set up a non-racial, not-for-profit, organization based upon the same principles adopted by the Institute of Management (UK), now the Chartered Management Institute.\n\nTogether with the three founding business CEO’s—they collectively donated £5000.00 out of their own pockets to start the enterprise—and hence the SAIM was born.",

It was founded on a parcel of land acquired from the Wildebeest Farm and deeded to the AME Church at the beginning to the last century. Similarly, in the United State of America, the AME Church was continuing its mission with the establishment of colleges, such as Wilberforce University, Morris Brown College and Payne Theological Seminary to name a few.\n\nWilberforce was unique in that it was founded, staffed and occupied almost exclusively by persons of African decent. There was little or no government involvement in the early years. The meagre funds that were garnered from various congregations across the United States were parlayed to build the early buildings, establish the curriculum and generally fulfil the mission of the University, referred to us “Unity with the Community”.",

  "Description": "The African Academy for the Built Environment was founded in 1994. Two patrons, D W Macnamara and C L Yeatman realised that was a shortage of well-trained Draughtspersons and decided that something should be done about it. This resulted in the birth of the African Academy for Computer Aided Draughting with the main purpose of training Draughtspersons. With help from industry computers, software and premises (sponsored by BATEMAN) were acquired. A pilot program of 12 weeks with 8 students commenced in September 1994. This was so successful that they decided to formally launch the Academy. Three 3 staff members were appointed and recruitment of more students took place.",

  "Description": "When Arwyp Medical Centre opened its doors in May 1986, all expectations were exceeded as it soon grew into one of the biggest medical centres in the country. Due to this rapid growth as well as to the need to satisfy market expectations and to differentiate the hospital’s services from those of its competitors, it became obvious that there was a need for specialised in-house training.\n\nThe training of nurses at Arwyp began in 1996 beginning with a two year bridging programme presented in cooperation with the Ann Latsky Nursing College. As the need for adequately trained nurses became more apparent, accreditation as a nursing school was applied for and obtained. The first auxiliary nursing course commenced in January 1999. The Arwyp Training Institute was formally launched in September 2001. By December 2001, the institute had trained 24 auxiliary nurses, 5 enrolled nurses and 18 registered nurses and was well on its way to becoming the accomplished and well-recognised training facility it is today.",

The monks appealed to women in their home parishes in Europe for assistance and five women responded who formed the foundation of the Missionary Sisters of the Precious Blood which is the Religious Order of nuns that still owns the Hospital today. Today the Hospital is governed by St Mary’s Catholic Mission Hospital Trust.\nThe Hospital is situated in Pinetown, just off the N3 highway, in the outer district of Ethekwini Municipality in KwaZulu –Natal province. It is a 200-bed, Level 1 District Hospital, serving a population of approximately 1 million and acts as a referral\nHospital for about 16 provincial and municipal primary healthcare clinics as well as 2 community health centres (CHCs).\nThe surrounding community is largely deprived and the hospital is the only district hospital in the area. To this end hospital has been receiving grant funding from the KZN Department of Health to deliver level 1 public health services to patients.",

Where after he decided to establish Gauteng Distance College in 1998.\n\nAfter an overwhelming response throughout the whole country he decided to rename the institution to Technicol SA College.\n\nThe name change was important to him to emphasize the availability of education and opportunity to everyone throughout South Africa. This paved the way not only for students that were shown away but also those with working responsibilities to better themselves without having to sacrifice their income. Since the establishment of this family driven company Technicol SA College has become not only the biggest privately owned college but also strives to provide a golden standard of service.",

  "Description": "Good Hope Studies was founded in 1995. The idea was to open a language school that was different from all the other schools. We wanted to provide a learning environment which is relaxed and fun to study in. Instead of renting cheap office space in the noisy city centre, we started our first school in a lovely private house in the leafy residential area of Newlands. The school was close to the host families, saving students on travel time. It was also close to public transport and close to the commercial centre of Claremont, an area that offers all amenities like restaurants, supermarkets, banks, cinemas, bars and more. Our students learnt English in the shade of an old oak tree instead of listening to the dull hum of air-conditioning. It turned out that students loved our concept and they progressed much faster than in a conventional environment.",

The dynamic and evolutionary nature of the healthcare industry, brought about by the increased demand for limited health care resources within the constraints of government’s goal of universal access to quality healthcare for all its citizens has changed the landscape significantly.",
