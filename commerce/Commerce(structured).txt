ADDITIONAL ADMISSION CRITERIA FOR PROCEEDING TO SENIOR YEARS 
IN STREAMS CONTAINING LAW
Students hoping to take a  law by commerce program may only proceed to the 
law pvl 1000-level courses if they have received confirmation that they have 
been allocated a place on those courses.
The number of  places available on the PVL 1000-level courses is limited and varies from year 
to year.  Places are allocated on a competitive basis to students with the highest aggregates 
and in accordance with the Law Faculty’s redress enrolment targets.  
To be eligible for consideration for a possible (but not guaranteed) 
place on the PVL 1000-level courses, students must have 
completed and passed all courses in the prescribed 
curriculum prior to the year of including the pvl 
1000-level courses at first attempt and obtained an 
aggregate of at least 63 for all such courses. 
Results in supplementary examinations are not 
included when calculating the aggregate but 
results of deferred examinations are included.  
NOTE:  the 63 aggregate is the 
minimum requirement for students to 
be eligible for consideration for a place 
on the law PVL 1000-level courses. It 
does not guarantee a place.  Given the 
large number of students who apply 
to take those courses and the fact that 
places are limited and are offered on 
a competitive basis to students with 
the highest aggregates, it is likely that 
a student will require an aggregate well 
above 63 in order to actually receive 
a place.
