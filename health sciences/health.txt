ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICANTS HOLDING THE NATIONAL 
SENIOR CERTIFICATE
PLEASE NOTE: All degrees within Health Sciences
• APS = NSC score (score out of 600). The APS is worked out as follows: percentages 
of three required subjects plus percentages of next three best subjects excluding Life 
Orientation.
• NBT = National Benchmark Tests (score out of 300). The results are published in 
Proficient/Intermediate /Basic ranges.
• FPS = The Faculty Points Score (FPS) (score out of 900).  This consists of the 
percentages of three required subjects plus percentages of next three best subjects 
but excluding Life Orientation, plus the NBT score.
• WPS = Weighted Points Score (score out of 1080). The WPS is used in Band B only 
and consists of your FPS weighted by your disadvantage factor (see the section on 
the general Admissions Policy for an explanation of the disadvantage factors).
NATIONAL BENCHMARK TESTS
 
All secondary school leaving applicants must write some or all components of the NBTs, 
consisting of the Academic and Quantitative Literacy Test (AQL) and Mathematics Test. NBT 
results contribute up to 300 points towards your Faculty Points Score. Applicants applying for 
admission to MBChB and Physiotherapy need to have NBT results that are in the Intermediate 
or Proficient Applicants to Audiology, Speech-Language Pathology Occupational Therapy 
who did Mathematical Literacy are advised to not write NBT Mathematics. Their applications 
will be considered individually, on merit.
Applicants to the Higher Certificate in Disability Practice need to write only the Academic 
and Quantitative Literacy components of the NBTs. Applicants to the Advanced Diploma 
in Cosmetic Formulation Science need not write the NBTs
HOW WE CALCULATE YOUR FACULTY POINTS SCORE (FPS) FOR THE 
DEGREE PROGRAMMES 
The following are added if you are an NSC candidate:
• Points (percentage) out of 100 for each of English, Mathematics and Physical 
Sciences;
• Points out of 100 for each of your next three best subjects excluding Life 
Orientation
• An additional 10 points if you have passed a third official South African language 
at Home or First Additional Language Level 
• Points out of 300 for the National Benchmark Tests.
• This gives you a total FPS out of 900
• We do not score Advanced Programme Mathematics or Advanced Programme 
English since these are not approved NSC subjects.

INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL-LEAVING CERTIFICATES
If you take a non-South African secondary school-leaving examination, we will consider your 
application by:
• Assessing your academic performance, using the rating tables on page 17
• Assessing your performance in the National Benchmark Tests;
• Comparing your overall performance to that of other applicants
A table is used to convert non-NSC results to a comparable score, where possible – see 
Admission Points Table for A, AS, IGCSE and IB Diplomas on page 17 of this Prospectus. Please 
note, applicants require six different eligible subjects, the subjects must meet the requirements 
for a Matric Exemption and applicants must meet the required NBT performance. 
In addition, candidates writing A-level, AS-level, IGCSE or IB Diploma examinations must meet 
the following minimum admission score requirements, obtained using the scoring examples 
in the SCORE CALCULATION TABLE FOR SELECTED NON-SOUTH AFRICAN EXAMINING 
AUTHORITIES. 
Note 1 . The same subject cannot be counted twice. 
Note 2.  Meeting the minimum requirements does not guarantee admission.
