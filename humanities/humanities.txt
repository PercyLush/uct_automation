of the curriculum. The NBT test is also used as a placement indicator to identify applicants in need 
of language development courses, or other additional academic support; and as an indicator, along 
with the FPS, of eligibility for an early offer or an Entrance Scholarship. South African applicants will 
usually not be considered until an NBT score is available. Applicants who are unable to write the NBT 
test during the scheduled sessions in the year preceding admission (for example an applicant who is 
out of the country on a gap year) may be made a conditional offer on the basis of excellent results, 
on condition that the NBT test is written, and results available, prior to Orientation and Registration. 
No Entrance Scholarship will be awarded without an NBT score.
NSC REQUIREMENTS SELECTION PROCEDURES
Applicants are considered on the basis of final secondary school-leaving results and the NBT score. 
Where final secondary school-leaving results are not available, the Faculty will initially consider an 
application for a provisional or conditional offer on the basis of internal examination results and the 
NBT score. 
In addition to the selection process and admission points requirements, admission to the Performing 
and Creative Arts degrees includes the assessment of a portfolio and/or a successful audition. 
Please refer to the specific admission requirements stipulated for Fine Art, Theatre & Performance, 
Dance and Music. These are in the tables on pages 60 - 61.
Applicants for the Performing and Creative Arts are advised to liaise with the relevant departments

SCHOOL-LEAVING QUALIFICATIONS
Applications are also invited from those who have successfully completed a non-South African 
secondary school-leaving qualification. To be considered for admission, all applicants must 
qualify for matriculation exemption from the Matriculation Board. The criteria specified for 
matriculation exemption are the minimum entry requirements and do not guarantee admission. 
The sole subject requirement for all qualifications is English for which a pass is required for 
admission. Some qualifications may carry additional subject requirements, and particular 
subjects may also be required for matriculation exemption.
Admission is competitive and each application is evaluated individually on its merits. Assessment 
is based on performance in the top six secondary school leaving subjects, that must include 
English but excluding Life Orientation and any of the AP subjects beginning with the most senior 
subject passed. A points rating system is used to guide admission decisions. The APS in the 
tables below reflect the level at which you are likely to receive an offer. While your application 
is assessed with reference to your APS, additional factors may be taken into account and each 
application is considered on its individual merits, particularly for admission to qualifications in 
the performing and creative arts.
All applicants who are normally resident, or at school, in South Africa must write the NBT. As 
the NBT assesses entry-level academic proficiency, applicants are expected to attain a Proficient 
score on the Academic Literacy portion of the test.
The following information is a guide for applicants with Cambridge Assessment International 
Education (CAIE) and the International Baccalaureate Diploma (IB) school-leaving qualifications. 
CAIE applicants with only GCSE/ IGSCE/ levels subjects are not eligible for admission.
GENERAL CERTIFICATE OF EDUCATION ADVANCED AND ADVANCED 
SUBSIDIARY (GCE A-LEVEL AND AS-LEVEL) APPLICANTS
To meet the minimum requirements for matriculation exemption, applicants must hold at least 
two A-level subjects at a grade of E or above and at least three IGSCE/ GSCE subjects at a 
grade of C or above including English Language and an approved second language.  Where an 
applicant does not hold A-levels, at least four AS-levels are required at grade D or above and at 
least one approved IGSCE/ GSCE subject at a grade of C or above including English Language 
and an approved second language.  
It is important to note that matriculation exemption requires specific subject combinations and 
that certain subjects are not recognised. To qualify for admission to Humanities qualifications, 
applicants should have passed two A-level subjects at grade C or above. Where an applicant 
has not completed A-level subjects, AS-levels may be accepted at the rate of two AS-levels for 
each required A-level.
